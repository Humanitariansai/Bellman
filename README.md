# Bellman: An Open Source Experimental Framework for Hybrid RL-LLM Agents

**Bridging Classical RL and Modern Language Models: Learning Through Integration**

Named after Richard Bellman—the pioneering mathematician whose optimality principle revolutionized reinforcement learning—the Bellman framework represents an educational experiment exploring the integration of classical RL methodologies with large language models. With its central question "How has the classical RL framework evolved with modern agents?", this open-source platform challenges the tendency to use LLMs as standalone agents by investigating how bandits, tabular RL, and policy gradients can be systematically combined with language models to create more robust agentic systems.

## The Foundational Layers: Exploring Integration Methodologies

At the core of the Bellman experiment lies its integration division—components designed to test different methods of combining classical reinforcement learning techniques with the reasoning capabilities of large language models.

**Bandit Integration Agents** function as experimental testbeds for multi-armed bandit algorithms working alongside LLMs. These agents explore different approaches to balancing exploration and exploitation when language models suggest multiple potential actions. The goal is to discover which exploration strategies yield optimal results when combined with LLM reasoning.

"The bandit integration agents allow us to experiment with exploration-exploitation trade-offs in language-guided systems," explains Professor Nik Bear Brown, PhD, MBA. "We're building to learn how statistical sampling methods can complement or override LLM confidence in different scenarios."

**Tabular RL Agents** serve as the framework's structured memory components, testing approaches to maintaining and updating state-action value tables that can be referenced by language models. This experimental layer explores how explicit value representations might enhance LLM decision-making in environments with clear state definitions.

"In purely LLM-based agents, value estimation happens implicitly, if at all," notes Professor Nik Bear Brown, PhD, MBA. "Bellman's tabular layer lets us experiment with explicit value tracking that language models can reference during reasoning."

**Policy Gradient Agents** explore how to effectively train neural policies that can either complement or constrain LLM outputs. These experimental agents test methods for learning optimal behaviors through direct experience, providing action distributions that language models can incorporate into their reasoning process.

## The Coordination Mechanisms: Testing Integration Architectures

While the foundational layers experiment with specific RL techniques, Bellman's coordination mechanisms explore different architectural approaches to integration.

**Sequential Processing Agents** test approaches where classical RL components and language models operate in a pipeline. These experimental architectures explore different sequences—from RL-first approaches where language models explain or refine RL decisions, to LLM-first approaches where RL methods validate or select from LLM-generated options.

"The sequential agents let us experiment with different division of responsibilities," says Professor Nik Bear Brown, PhD, MBA. "We're building various processing pipelines to learn which sequencing actually produces optimal decision-making."

**Parallel Processing Agents** implement experimental architectures where RL and LLM components operate simultaneously. These agents test different approaches to weighing or combining outputs, from weighted averaging to contextual selection mechanisms that determine which system should dominate in specific scenarios.

**Hierarchical Integration Agents** explore methodologies for creating multi-level decision systems. Rather than assuming flat integration is optimal, these experimental agents test approaches where different techniques operate at different levels of abstraction—for example, using LLMs for high-level planning while RL handles low-level execution.

## The Learning Mechanisms: Exploring Adaptation Methodologies

Bellman's experimental approach extends to learning processes, exploring how hybrid systems might improve over time.

**Cross-Technique Transfer Agents** test various approaches to sharing knowledge between RL and LLM components. These experimental mechanisms explore different methods for translating insights from one paradigm to another, allowing us to discover which knowledge transfer approaches are most effective.

"The transfer agents represent our commitment to learning through building," emphasizes Professor Nik Bear Brown, PhD, MBA. "We're experimenting with different ways to ensure insights from one technique can enhance the performance of others."

**Meta-Learning Agents** explore methodologies for adapting the integration architecture itself based on performance. This experimental component helps us discover effective approaches to dynamically adjusting the balance between RL and LLM influence as conditions change.

**Curriculum Learning Agents** test different approaches to gradually increasing task complexity. These experimental components identify optimal progression paths that allow hybrid systems to master fundamentals before tackling more challenging problems.

## The Evaluation Framework: Testing Performance Assessment

To ensure Bellman's experimental approaches can be systematically compared, we're testing a comprehensive evaluation framework.

**Comparative Benchmark Agents** explore different approaches to measuring performance against pure-LLM and pure-RL baselines. These experimental components test methodologies for isolating the specific contributions of integration across diverse task environments.

**Ablation Study Agents** experiment with systematically removing or isolating components to understand their contribution. Unlike simplistic on/off testing, these experimental agents test approaches to measuring interaction effects between techniques.

**Interpretability Agents** explore methodologies for understanding the reasoning behind decisions in hybrid systems. These experimental components test approaches to tracing the influence of different techniques on final outputs.

**Robustness Assessment Agents** experiment with evaluating performance across distribution shifts and unexpected scenarios, testing how different integration approaches handle novel situations.

## The Bellman Core: Experimenting with Optimization Principles

At the heart of the framework sits the experimental Bellman core—testing approaches to ensuring that hybrid systems adhere to Bellman's optimality principle while leveraging the strengths of modern language models.

"The Bellman core is where we experiment with optimality itself," explains Professor Nik Bear Brown, PhD, MBA. "Classical RL uses dynamic programming and value iteration to find optimal policies. The Bellman core lets us test methods for incorporating language model reasoning while maintaining these mathematical guarantees."

This experimental optimization layer explores several key mechanisms:

**Value-Guided Reasoning** tests approaches to constraining LLM outputs based on value functions. Rather than allowing language models to generate actions based solely on pre-training, the experimental Bellman core explores methods for ensuring actions align with learned value estimates.

**Dynamic Consistency Verification** explores approaches to checking whether LLM-generated plans satisfy the Bellman equation. When significant inconsistencies are detected, we test how quickly and effectively reasoning can be redirected.

**Temporal Abstraction Integration** experiments with combining hierarchical RL approaches like options or skills with language model planning. Like its namesake who developed mathematical frameworks for complex sequential decision problems, the experimental Bellman core tests approaches to breaking down tasks across multiple time scales.

**Uncertainty-Aware Decision Optimization** explores methodologies for explicitly representing and reasoning about uncertainty in hybrid systems. The experimental Bellman core tests approaches to balancing exploration and exploitation while considering both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness) and epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge).

**Experience Accumulation** tests how the entire framework might integrate online learning with pre-trained knowledge. The experimental Bellman core tracks how experience modifies decision-making across different integration architectures to discover which approaches most effectively combine prior knowledge with direct experience.

## The Educational Philosophy: Building to Discover Integration Principles

The Bellman framework was designed with a clear educational philosophy: to build systems that help us learn what actually works when combining classical reinforcement learning with large language models. The project explicitly embraces experimentation and discovery rather than assuming LLMs alone represent the optimal approach to agentic AI.

"We're building to discover fundamental principles of integration," emphasizes Professor Nik Bear Brown, PhD, MBA. "This open-source experiment is about learning which combinations of techniques actually help agents make better decisions across diverse environments. We don't have all the answers—that's precisely why we're building."

This approach distinguishes Bellman from approaches that treat LLMs as complete agents requiring only prompting or fine-tuning. The framework's transparency allows contributors to understand the reasoning behind each component, challenge assumptions, and discover through experimentation which integration approaches yield the most robust decision-making.

As agentic AI continues to evolve, the Bellman educational experiment offers a compelling alternative to pure LLM approaches. By building and testing hybrid systems that combine the statistical rigor of classical RL with the reasoning capabilities of language models, we're creating an educational platform that discovers what actually works in practice.

Whether some of Bellman's experimental approaches will prove effective remains to be seen—that's the nature of educational experimentation. But in systematically exploring the integration of established RL techniques with modern language models under the guidance of Bellman's optimality principle, the framework represents a significant opportunity for collaborative learning—one that could help us develop more capable, reliable, and understandable agents for addressing complex real-world problems.
