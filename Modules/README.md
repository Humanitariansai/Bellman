# Module One: Foundations of Hybrid RL-LLM Systems

Module One introduces the fundamental concepts of integrating classical reinforcement learning with large language models. This module covers:

- **Core Integration Approaches**: Explores three foundational integration methods through real-world examples:
  - **Bandit Integration** (BanditPrompt): Using multi-armed bandits to select between LLM-generated options, improving customer service response selection by 27%
  - **Tabular RL Integration** (ExplainRL): Combining Q-learning with LLM explanations to create transparent yet statistically sound decision-making
  - **Policy Gradient Integration** (GradientGuide): Using neural policies to constrain and guide LLM planning for more efficient resource allocation

- **Architectural Patterns**: Examines three structural approaches to RL-LLM integration:
  - **Sequential Processing**: LLM-first or RL-first pipelines where components operate in succession
  - **Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous operation with learned weighting mechanisms
  - **Hierarchical Integration**: Using LLMs for high-level planning and RL for low-level execution

- **Integration Mechanisms**: Explores techniques for effective component interaction:
  - **Value-Guided Reasoning**: Injecting RL-derived value estimates into LLM prompts
  - **Consistency Verification**: Checking LLM-generated plans against Bellman optimality
  - **Uncertainty-Aware Decision Making**: Explicitly representing and reasoning about different uncertainty types

- **Case Studies**: Each concept is illustrated through practical examples with performance metrics and implementation insights from systems like ValuePrompt, DualDecide, and UncertaintyBridge.

This module provides the essential toolkit for understanding how classical RL techniques can complement and enhance LLM capabilities in decision-making systems, with empirical evidence of performance improvements across multiple domains.
